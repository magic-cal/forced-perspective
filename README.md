# forced-perspective

This is a test to run two separate instances of a VR environnement which are linked by a socket
This allows two screens to be directly linked providing similar content, without having to be a direct mirror

## TODO:

- Add HTTPS Support to use on external devices
- fix jittery issues with updates
- Provide a cleaner UI to interact with
- Make a interface for perspective mirroring
